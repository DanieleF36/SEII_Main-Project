## PROCESS MEASURES 

### Macro statistics

- Number of stories committed vs. done : 5 vs. 5
- Total points committed vs. done : 17 vs. 17
- Nr of hours planned vs. spent (as a team): 88h 45m vs. 103h 30m

**Remember**a story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:
 
- Unit Tests passing
- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End tests performed


### Detailed statistics

| Story  | # Tasks | Points | Hours est. | Hours actual |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|--------------|
| _#0_   |    9    |        |  45h 45m   |    45h 50m   |
| _#1_   |    4    |   3    |    9h      |    11h 30m   |
| _#2_   |    5    |   5    |    12h     |    16h 15m   |
| _#3_   |    3    |   3    |    7h      |    8h 5m     |
| _#4_   |    4    |   3    |    8h      |    11h 15m   |
| _#5_   |    4    |   3    |    7h      |    10h 30m   |


- Hours per task average, standard deviation (estimate and actual) : estimate task average: 3.06 , actual task average: 3.56 , standard deviation : 1.66
- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / (sum of total hours spent - 1) : 0.86

  
## QUALITY MEASURES 

- Unit Testing:
  - Total hours estimated : 10h
  - Total hours spent : 10h 15m
  - Nr of automated unit test cases : 39
  - Coverage (if available) : 78%
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated: 14h
  - Total hours spent: 15h 30m
- Code review 
  - Total hours estimated: 5h
  - Total hours spent : 5h 45m
  


## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)? Due to over understim

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint? Better knowledge about team members, bad team organization and enviroment use (Github branch management issue)

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? n/a 
  
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why? n/a

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.) :

  > branch management : doing internet research, discussing with team members during planning
  
  > integration test : searching documentation, diving deep in the framework

- One thing you are proud of as a Team: responsability of each team member and comunication
