- [quality measures](#quality-measures)
- [general assessment](#assessment)

## PROCESS MEASURES 

### Macro statistics

- Number of stories committed vs. done : 5 vs. 5
- Total points committed vs. done : 17 vs. 17
- Nr of hours planned vs. spent (as a team): 88h 45m vs. 103h 30m

**Remember**a story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:
 
- Unit Tests passing
- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End tests performed


### Detailed statistics

| Story  | # Tasks | Points | Hours est. | Hours actual |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|--------------|
| _#0_   |    9    |        |  45h 45m   |    45h 50m   |
| _#1_   |    4    |   3    |    9h      |    11h 30m   |
| _#2_   |    5    |   5    |    12h     |    16h 15m   |
| _#3_   |    3    |   3    |    7h      |    8h 5m     |
| _#4_   |    4    |   3    |    8h      |    11h 15m   |
| _#5_   |    4    |   3    |    7h      |    10h 30m   |


- Hours per task average, standard deviation (estimate and actual) : estimate task average: 3.06 , actual task average: 3.56 , standard deviation : 1.29
- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / (sum of total hours spent - 1) : 0.86

  
## QUALITY MEASURES 

- Unit Testing:
  - Total hours estimated : 10h
  - Total hours spent : 10h 15m
  - Nr of automated unit test cases : 39
  - Coverage (if available) : 78%
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated: 14h
  - Total hours spent: 15h 30m
- Code review 
  - Total hours estimated: 5h
  - Total hours spent : 5h 45m
  


## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)? For this sprint we have understimate the spent hours for each tasks because we focused on a better tasks     division that made more difficult the tasks estimation. We also forgot to compute the total amount of hour after the tasks estimation to compare it to the total amount team's hours. 

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint? In this sprint we understood how to divide the tasks and how to manage the branches of the repository. The negative lesson we learnt is that the team division was too strict and we have noticed lack in communication 

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? The improvement goals that we were able to achieve from previous
retrospective were better tasks division and organization (has to be improved) and better branches management. 
  
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why? We were not able to learn how to automate end-to-end test because we focused more on achieving the definition of done of user stories

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.) :

  > better estimation of time for each tasks and better planning of assegnation tasks
  > working on team communication through more Scrum Meeting
  > complete learning of the SAML authentication and virtual clock

- One thing you are proud of as a Team: we are proud about tasks division and how everyone was responsible for their tasks
